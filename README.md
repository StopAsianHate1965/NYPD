This is a repository on anti-asian hate in NYC. 
https://github.com/StopAsianHate1965/NYPD.git

I have examined two sources, #1 is a national paper and #2 is NYPD's own data. I am an anonymous amateur. Feel free to do your own research.

First Source:
There was a national study done on hate crimes, looking at similarities and differences.
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7790522/

It was found that like 99% of anti-black hate crimes are done by white people, but only like 75% of anti-asian and anti-latin hate crimes are done by white people.

Second Source:
NYPD maintains annulat statistics for hate crimes.
https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/hate-crimes.page

Their data for hate crime complaints is a little messy, but I tried sorting and cleaning it.

NYPD also has data for hate crime arrests.

Objectively, the majority of those arrested for anti-asian hate crimes are black. I attempted to make a few graphs but feel free to create your own datasets.

All files are hosted here:

AUTHOR NOTE:
The question then becomes why does this exist? This is not meant to create intra-POC tensions, but to instead highlight the issues that come with creating a model minority.
APIDA individuals should not be the buffer zone punching bags, absorbing the animosities created by white supremacy. Further, it is interesting to notice that the number of anti-jewish hate crimes committed by asians increased in 2021.
We are all crabs in a bucket.

PS:
Let us not forget that while we often focus on race, class tensions are likely also a contribution.
